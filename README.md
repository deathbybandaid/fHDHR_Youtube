Welcome to the world of streaming content as a DVR device! We use some fancy python here to achieve a system of:

**f**un
**H**ome
**D**istribution
**H**iatus
**R**ecreation


Please Check the [Docs](docs/README.md) for Installation information.

fHDHR is labeled as beta until we reach v1.0.0

Join us in `#fHDHR <irc://irc.freenode.net/#fHDHR>`_ on Freenode.

# !!NOTICE!!

To reduce code duplication between variants, I am moving to a plugin system.
The normal variant repos will stay active during the transition.
